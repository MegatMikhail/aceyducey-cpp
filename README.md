# Acey Deucey in C++

This is a simulation of the Acey Deucey card game written in C++. In this game, the dealer deals two cards to the player, who then can bet on a third card's outcome. The player wins the bet if the value of the third card falls between the value of the first and second cards.

I translated this game from the 1978 book "BASIC Computer Games" from Creative Computing. The original program author was Bill Palmby of Prairie View, Illinois, and I simply translated it from the original BASIC to C++ to practice my programming skills.
